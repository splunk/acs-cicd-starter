# Manage Indexes

For detailed information, see official ACS Documentation: [Manage indexes in Splunk Cloud Platform](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SplunkCloud/latest/Config/ManageIndexes).

In this demo, each index should be defined as a separate json file using the index name as the filename, this way we can itterate through changes.
